detecting objects with geolocation

Unfortunately I cannot upload the program. The example video shows the usage. The GPs data and time can either be added by the camera itself or added later by the program.

I took the video form the youtube channel "Eure Videos Fahrn√ºnftig" and changed the framerate and quality.
The video was also cliped
